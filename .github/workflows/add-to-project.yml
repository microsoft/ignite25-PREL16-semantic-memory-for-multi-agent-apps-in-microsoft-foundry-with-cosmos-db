# This workflow automatically adds new issues to the Ignite GitHub Project and applies labels
# based on issue content. It is triggered when issues are opened.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure the IGNITE_PROJECT_URL repository variable with the actual GitHub Project URL
#    Example: https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/123
# 2. Configure the ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT secret with a Personal Access Token that has:
#    - 'repo' scope for repository access
#    - 'project' scope for GitHub Projects access
#
# For more information about GitHub Projects and automation, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project
